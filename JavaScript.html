        JavaScript was introduced as a full-fledged client-side language used for developing web applications in 1995. JavaScript is easy to learn, debug, and test. It is an event-based, platform-independent, and an interpreted language with all the procedural programming capabilities.

Web applications that were developed using server-side programming languages like Java and Dot Net involved travel of user requests all the way from the client(browser) to the server hosting the application. The multiple request-response cycles between client and server who were consuming both time and network bandwidth.

JavaScript got introduced as a Client-Side programming language with the capability of executing user requests on the Client-Side. This could help in reducing the number of request-response cycles between client and server and decrease the network bandwidth thus reducing the overall response time.

Later, in 1997 ECMAScript established a standard for the scripting languages that redefined the core features any scripting language should have and how to implement those features. From then, JavaScript evolved year after year with every new version of ECMAScript introducing new features. Developers prefer JavaScript to create dynamic, interactive, and scalable web applications as it helps developers in extending the functionalities of the web pages effectively.

This course will enable you to understand the features of ECMA and help to develop more robust web applications using JavaScript and handle user requests on the Client-Side.
